Portfolio) aims to deliver a high absolute return over rolling 
three to five years by investing in Australian small companies, 
while at the same time attempting to minimise the risk of

50% in cash.
",0,australian_small.pdf,1
6921,9,"2. 
MODEL PORTFOLIO STRATEGY
",0,australian_small.pdf,1
6922,10,"The Model Portfolio offers the opportunity to invest in a 
selection of Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) listed 
companies that have been identified by the investment team as 
having under-recognised growth potential. These companies 
generally have one of the following characteristics:
",0,australian_small.pdf,1
6923,11,"•	
A market-leading, multi-year competitive advantage;
",0,australian_small.pdf,1

whole or within a critical element of the business; or
",0,australian_small.pdf,1
6925,13,"•	
A specific catalyst expected to generate short-medium 
term capital appreciation.
",0,australian_small.pdf,1
6926,14,"The Model Portfolio follows a concentrated, long-only strategy 
that results in typically 10 - 30 investments. Eight Investment 
Partners (8IP or the Program Adviser) is a bottom-up stock 
investor that seeks to deliver absolute returns over the medium 
to long term (3 to 5 years). 
",0,australian_small.pdf,1
6927,15,"The key to the success of the investment process is the 
combined experience of the investment team and the access 
to a network that can provide insights into Australian small 
companies.
",0,australian_small.pdf,1
6928,16,"Mason Stevens, as the Managed Discretionary Account (MDA) 
Operator, will administer and implement the Model Portfolio 
on the instructions of 8IP, and report back all changes as 
advised by 8IP on a regular basis (see Section 17 on page 9 
for “Reporting to You”). 
",0,australian_small.pdf,1
6929,17,"It is expected that the performance of the Model Portfolio will

RISKS
",0,australian_small.pdf,3
6963,51,"Before you make an investment decision it is important that 
you understand the risks that can affect your investment. 
",0,australian_small.pdf,3
6964,52,"All forms of investment involve a degree of risk. This could be 
that your investment does not meet your investment objectives 
or that you lose money on your investment.
",0,australian_small.pdf,3
6965,53,"Specific investment risks apply to all investments that may 
have an effect on the value of your Managed Account. The 
risks of investing in the Model Portfolio may include, but are 
not limited to, the following factors:
",0,australian_small.pdf,3
6966,54,"•	
Investment risk - All investments have an inherent 
level of risk. The general expectation is that a high risk 
investment offers a higher expected return on investment. 
Investment risk may result in performance less than you 
expect or the loss of all of the capital invested or reduction 
in or no income and possible delays in repayment. Whilst 
it is the intention of the Program Adviser to implement 
strategies designed to minimise potential losses, there can 
be no assurance that these strategies will be successful.
",0,australian_small.pdf,3
6967,55,"•	
Specific Portfolio Risk - The Program Adviser’s 
investment approach may result in a model portfolio that 
differs substantially from an industry benchmark and 
hence the Model Portfolio’s investment returns may also 
differ substantially from industry benchmark returns.
",0,australian_small.pdf,3
6968,56,"•	
Market risk – Unexpected conditions such as economic, 
technological or political events can have a negative 
impact on the returns of all investments within a particular 
market. General movements in local and international 
markets, prevailing and anticipated economic conditions, 
investor sentiment, interest rates and exchange rates 
could all affect the value of securities and the investment 
returns.
",0,australian_small.pdf,3
6969,57,"•	
Company or security risk – Risks which could affect 
the value of a specific security, such as a fall in the profit 
performance of a company, may impact adversely on its 
market price and may also affect the interest rate it has to 
pay to borrow funds, which in turn, can affect the value 
of its securities. The financial performance of the issuer is 
critical to the payment of the coupon or other distribution 
on investments and their redemption or conversion (all of 
which affect their market value). There is a risk that the 
issuer will default in paying the yield or in redeeming the 
investment. Issuers which are special purpose vehicles 
might not be financially supported by a rated corporate 
or financial entity and their assets which back the 
investments might become valueless.
",0,australian_small.pdf,3
6970,58,"•	
Economic Risk - A downturn in the general economic 
conditions in Australia or globally may adversely affect the 
performance of the Model Portfolio.
",0,australian_small.pdf,3
6971,59,"•	
Liquidity Risk – This portfolio invests primarily in small-
cap stocks and may carry a heightened risk that certain 
investments in the portfolio may be difficult to purchase 
or sell, preventing closing out of a position or rebalancing 
within a timely period and at a fair price. Trade execution 
is on a best endeavors basis and may be negatively 
impacted by bid / offer spreads, available liquidity, or other 
market forces affecting both the performance of your

Inflation Risk - Your investment may not keep pace 
with inflation. Broadly, this could mean that prices may 
increase more than the value of your investments in the 
Model Portfolio and if this risk eventuates, you would not 
be able to buy as much with the value of your investments 
in the future as you could now. 
",0,australian_small.pdf,3
6973,61,"•	
Concentration Risk - If your portfolio is concentrated 
into one investment or sector, a fall in that investment 
or sector may have a significant adverse effect on your 
total portfolio. Diversification is used as a strategy aimed 
at reducing the impact that volatility in one investment 
or sector will have on the performance of your overall 
portfolio. The Model Portfolio will have a relatively higher 
concentration over time of listed securities but it is not 
possible to advise in advance the levels of concentration 
or diversification of issuers, types of investments or 
industry sectors.
",0,australian_small.pdf,3
6974,62,"•	
Interest Rate Risk - Changes in interest rates will affect 
the value of interest bearing securities and shares in some 
companies. Rises in interest rates may lead to loss in 
value and falls in interest rates may lead to rises in value.
",0,australian_small.pdf,3
6975,63,"•	
Program Adviser Risk - The performance of the Model 
Portfolio managed by the Program Adviser depends on 
the expertise and investment decisions of the appointed 
Program Adviser.
",0,australian_small.pdf,3
6976,64,"•	
Performance Risk - While the managed account service 
is managed within a risk management framework, the 
strategies adopted for the Model Portfolio may not be 
successful and the value of a total portfolio may decline.
",0,australian_small.pdf,3
6977,65,"•	
Time Horizon Risk - There is no assurance that in any 
time period, particularly in the short term, a portfolio will 
achieve its investment objectives. Many of the underlying 
assets may be volatile particularly over the short term. 
The Model Portfolio is suitable for medium to long term 
investors and is not designed for short term investment.
",0,australian_small.pdf,3
6978,66,"•	
Individual Investment Risk - Investments held by a 
portfolio can and do fall in value for many reasons, such 
as changes to the business operations, management, 
legislative or environmental factors that may affect the 
issuer of the investment. The value of an individual 
company’s securities may change as a result of factors 
such as changes in management, market sentiment 
or industry specific events. 8IP aims to reduce this risk 
through careful research and analysis, combined with a 
value bias investment approach and diversification.

Third Party Risk - The MDA Operator uses information 
and services provided by third parties such as sub-
custodians and other service providers. Procedures are 
in place to address risks associated with outsourcing, 
such as having comprehensive service agreements with 
service providers. If a service provider advises of an 
error, it is corrected and if material, it will generally be 
communicated to you or your advisor (or both).
",0,australian_small.pdf,4
6982,70,"•	
Systems and Technology Risk - The MDA Operator 
relies on the integrity and reliability of the Model Portfolio 
trading and administration systems used to manage your 
managed account. To minimise potential risks, established 
systems operated by experienced system providers 
are used. The system providers must have back-up 
arrangements and business continuity plans. In the event 
that the systems fail there may be delays in processing 
transactions or in accessing your investment capital and 
investment returns may differ from those that would have 
been achieved.
