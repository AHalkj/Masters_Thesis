As an example, when the capital ratio of the CoCo issuer falls under a certain level, which depends on the accounting rules currently applicable, the issuer needs to convert debt to equity and the CoCo holders receive common shares in exchange for the CoCo. This may happen at a time which is not ideal to buy the common shares and investors may also suffer a loss depending on the conversion ratio. The issuer's supervisory authority may intervene at any time in the conversion or written down process.

While this will increase the amount of income (which may be taxable) available for distribution to holders of the shares, investors should be aware that such charging to capital amounts to a return, or withdrawal, of part of an investor's original investment, or from any capital gains attributable to that original investment, this could erode capital and constrain future growth."",0.0,labelled\consorsbank_t_rowe_price_funds,68";;;;;;;;;;;

In exceptional cases where the buying and/or selling price is not available for bonds and other debt securities, but a mid-market price is known, the mid-market price will be adjusted using a suitable method to obtain the buying and/or selling price to be applied. This last method will be explained in the annual and/or semi-annual report.

By way of exception to the aforementioned, the fair value of shares in undertakings for collective investment with a variable number of units for which there is neither an organised nor an over-the-counter market will be calculated on the basis of the net asset value of these shares.

RISKS;;;;;;;;;;;

you understand the risks that can affect your investment. ;;;;;;;;;;;
",0.0,australian_small.pdf,3
5179,52,All forms of investment involve a degree of risk. This could be ";;;;;;;;;;;
that your investment does not meet your investment objectives ;;;;;;;;;;;
or that you lose money on your investment.;;;;;;;;;;;
",0.0,australian_small.pdf,3
5180,53,Specific investment risks apply to all investments that may ";;;;;;;;;;;
have an effect on the value of your Managed Account. The ;;;;;;;;;;;
risks of investing in the Model Portfolio may include, but are ;;;;;;;;;;;
not limited to, the following factors:;;;;;;;;;;;
",0.0,australian_small.pdf,3
5181,54,•	";;;;;;;;;;;
Investment risk - All investments have an inherent ;;;;;;;;;;;
level of risk. The general expectation is that a high risk ;;;;;;;;;;;
investment offers a higher expected return on investment. ;;;;;;;;;;;
Investment risk may result in performance less than you ;;;;;;;;;;;
expect or the loss of all of the capital invested or reduction ;;;;;;;;;;;
in or no income and possible delays in repayment. Whilst ;;;;;;;;;;;
it is the intention of the Program Adviser to implement ;;;;;;;;;;;
strategies designed to minimise potential losses, there can ;;;;;;;;;;;
be no assurance that these strategies will be successful.;;;;;;;;;;;
",0.0,australian_small.pdf,3
5182,55,•	";;;;;;;;;;;
Specific Portfolio Risk - The Program Adviser’s ;;;;;;;;;;;
investment approach may result in a model portfolio that ;;;;;;;;;;;
differs substantially from an industry benchmark and ;;;;;;;;;;;
hence the Model Portfolio’s investment returns may also ;;;;;;;;;;;
differ substantially from industry benchmark returns.;;;;;;;;;;;
",0.0,australian_small.pdf,3
5183,56,•	";;;;;;;;;;;
Market risk – Unexpected conditions such as economic, ;;;;;;;;;;;
technological or political events can have a negative ;;;;;;;;;;;
impact on the returns of all investments within a particular ;;;;;;;;;;;
market. General movements in local and international ;;;;;;;;;;;
markets, prevailing and anticipated economic conditions, ;;;;;;;;;;;
investor sentiment, interest rates and exchange rates ;;;;;;;;;;;
could all affect the value of securities and the investment ;;;;;;;;;;;
returns.;;;;;;;;;;;

Company or security risk – Risks which could affect ;;;;;;;;;;;

performance of a company, may impact adversely on its ;;;;;;;;;;;
market price and may also affect the interest rate it has to ;;;;;;;;;;;
pay to borrow funds, which in turn, can affect the value ;;;;;;;;;;;
of its securities. The financial performance of the issuer is ;;;;;;;;;;;
critical to the payment of the coupon or other distribution ;;;;;;;;;;;
on investments and their redemption or conversion (all of ;;;;;;;;;;;
which affect their market value). There is a risk that the ;;;;;;;;;;;
issuer will default in paying the yield or in redeeming the ;;;;;;;;;;;
investment. Issuers which are special purpose vehicles ;;;;;;;;;;;
might not be financially supported by a rated corporate ;;;;;;;;;;;
or financial entity and their assets which back the ;;;;;;;;;;;
investments might become valueless.;;;;;;;;;;;

conditions in Australia or globally may adversely affect the ;;;;;;;;;;;
performance of the Model Portfolio.;;;;;;;;;;;

Liquidity Risk – This portfolio invests primarily in small-;;;;;;;;;;;
cap stocks and may carry a heightened risk that certain ;;;;;;;;;;;
investments in the portfolio may be difficult to purchase ;;;;;;;;;;;
or sell, preventing closing out of a position or rebalancing ;;;;;;;;;;;
within a timely period and at a fair price. Trade execution ;;;;;;;;;;;
is on a best endeavors basis and may be negatively ;;;;;;;;;;;
impacted by bid / offer spreads, available liquidity, or other ;;;;;;;;;;;
market forces affecting both the performance of your ;;;;;;;;;;;
portfolio and timing of trade completion.;;;;;;;;;;;

5187,60,•	";;;;;;;;;;;
Inflation Risk - Your investment may not keep pace ;;;;;;;;;;;
with inflation. Broadly, this could mean that prices may ;;;;;;;;;;;
increase more than the value of your investments in the ;;;;;;;;;;;
Model Portfolio and if this risk eventuates, you would not ;;;;;;;;;;;
be able to buy as much with the value of your investments ;;;;;;;;;;;
in the future as you could now. ;;;;;;;;;;;
",0.0,australian_small.pdf,3
5188,61,•	";;;;;;;;;;;
Concentration Risk - If your portfolio is concentrated ;;;;;;;;;;;
into one investment or sector, a fall in that investment ;;;;;;;;;;;
or sector may have a significant adverse effect on your ;;;;;;;;;;;
total portfolio. Diversification is used as a strategy aimed ;;;;;;;;;;;
at reducing the impact that volatility in one investment ;;;;;;;;;;;
or sector will have on the performance of your overall ;;;;;;;;;;;
portfolio. The Model Portfolio will have a relatively higher ;;;;;;;;;;;
concentration over time of listed securities but it is not ;;;;;;;;;;;
possible to advise in advance the levels of concentration ;;;;;;;;;;;
or diversification of issuers, types of investments or ;;;;;;;;;;;
industry sectors.;;;;;;;;;;;

Interest Rate Risk - Changes in interest rates will affect ;;;;;;;;;;;
the value of interest bearing securities and shares in some ;;;;;;;;;;;
companies. Rises in interest rates may lead to loss in ;;;;;;;;;;;
value and falls in interest rates may lead to rises in value.;;;;;;;;;;;

successful and the value of a total portfolio may decline.;;;;;;;;;;;

5192,65,•	";;;;;;;;;;;
Time Horizon Risk - There is no assurance that in any ;;;;;;;;;;;
time period, particularly in the short term, a portfolio will ;;;;;;;;;;;
achieve its investment objectives. Many of the underlying ;;;;;;;;;;;
assets may be volatile particularly over the short term. ;;;;;;;;;;;
The Model Portfolio is suitable for medium to long term ;;;;;;;;;;;
investors and is not designed for short term investment.;;;;;;;;;;;
",0.0,australian_small.pdf,3

Individual Investment Risk - Investments held by a ;;;;;;;;;;;
portfolio can and do fall in value for many reasons, such ;;;;;;;;;;;
as changes to the business operations, management, ;;;;;;;;;;;
legislative or environmental factors that may affect the ;;;;;;;;;;;
issuer of the investment. The value of an individual ;;;;;;;;;;;
company’s securities may change as a result of factors ;;;;;;;;;;;
such as changes in management, market sentiment ;;;;;;;;;;;
or industry specific events. 8IP aims to reduce this risk ;;;;;;;;;;;
through careful research and analysis, combined with a ;;;;;;;;;;;
value bias investment approach and diversification.;;;;;;;;;;;

Third Party Risk - The MDA Operator uses information ;;;;;;;;;;;

in place to address risks associated with outsourcing, ;;;;;;;;;;;
such as having comprehensive service agreements with ;;;;;;;;;;;
service providers. If a service provider advises of an ;;;;;;;;;;;

Systems and Technology Risk - The MDA Operator ;;;;;;;;;;;
relies on the integrity and reliability of the Model Portfolio ;;;;;;;;;;;
trading and administration systems used to manage your ;;;;;;;;;;;
managed account. To minimise potential risks, established ;;;;;;;;;;;
systems operated by experienced system providers ;;;;;;;;;;;
are used. The system providers must have back-up ;;;;;;;;;;;
arrangements and business continuity plans. In the event ;;;;;;;;;;;
that the systems fail there may be delays in processing ;;;;;;;;;;;
transactions or in accessing your investment capital and ;;;;;;;;;;;
investment returns may differ from those that would have ;;;;;;;;;;;
